<h2> $\textcolor{brown}{\text{I. Introduction :}}$ </h2>

In this work we sumilate a company wich supplies computers hardware ans peripherals to clients (stores) across France, this company has a head office in Paris and has a lot of regional offices throughout France. 

Our Sales Director is facing a lot of chalenges: 
- the marking is growing dynamically so tracking sales is a real problem. 
- He has issues with the insight of bussiness in different region (The situation is that he calls his local regional manager and the information is verbal. and the regional managers try to paint a rosy picture of bussiness).
- The sales manager doesnt have the full picture to make data-driven decisions.

Purpose : To unlock sales insights that are not visible before for sales team fot decision support & automate them to reduced manual time spent in data gathering

End result : An automated dashbord providing quick & latest insghits in order to support data driven decision making 

Success Critearia : 
- Dashboard(s) uncovering sales insights with latest data available. 
- Sales team able to take better decisions & prove 10% cost saving of total spend
- Sales Analysts stop data gathering manually in order to save 20% of their bussiness time and reinvest it in value added activity 
In our case you can consider that we will do the work in a dirty way by working in operational database (Online Transaction Processing). But in real world, professionals work in Online Analytical Processing databases.
